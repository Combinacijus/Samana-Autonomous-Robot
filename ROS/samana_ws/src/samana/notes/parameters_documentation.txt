There is described all ROS parameters which could be change to tune robot

/arm_mode (int) (not a parameter)
    0: no move
    1: arm commands will be forced, both swithes up
    2: arm will move until limit or overcurrent switch or disarm, both swithes down

/armed (bool)       arm state set by arm switch
/auton_mode (bool)  if true robot goes into autonomous mode rc is ignored

/hoverboard/max_speed (int)     max speed command; clamped before sending to hoverboard
/hoverboard/max_steer (int)     max steer command; clamped before sending to hoverboard


--------------------------NEVER UPDATED IF CHANGED----------------------------------------
base_width - distance between hoverboard wheels in meters
rot_per_m_left  - (float) left encoder rotation per meter; must be found experimentally
rot_per_m_right - (float) right encoder rotation per meter; must be found experimentally

/init_allow_rc (bool)    if false any RC input will be ignored works only on init 
                         can be changed with service /set_allow_rc e.g.
                         rosservice call /set_allow_rc "data: true"
