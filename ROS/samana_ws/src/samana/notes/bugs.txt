CURRENT IMPORTANT:
stf_odom static transform from map to odom frame is published by rviz launch file problably needs to move to other file


SOFTWARE:
sonars detects bag as an obstacle. Fix by reducing max distance (to around 25cm so it wont detect low obstacles) and disabling lower front sonars
sonars detects low obstacles
after restarting STM32 odometry jumps a bit
rc Arduino can loose sync and won't recover without powering off (at least with RC on)
IMU gets biased for no reason. Possible solution to restart IMU.
Odometry: sometimes no /odom_data is received from Arduino even tho topic is published. This causes constant speed even after setting speed to 0. Need power off on

Hoverboard: /hov topic is not published from Arduino

HARDWARE:
STM32 requires reset for odometry to work
Voltage regulator for lift motor sometimes stops working



FIXED:
ekf_odom and odom tranform both publishes to tf so it jumps around
sonars randomly triggers needs some filtering
ekf_odometry will drift if Arduinos disconnect and after reconnect it will be far away from true position
Sometimes not all nodes are killed which uses a lot of resources
DWA planner: gives commands above max velocity and max acceleration limits. Sometime very jerky start
