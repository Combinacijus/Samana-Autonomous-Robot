SOFTWARE:
ekf_odometry will drift if Arduinos disconnect and after reconnect it will be far away from true position
sonars detects bag as an obstacle. Fix by reducing max distance (to around 25cm so it wont detect low obstacles) and disabling lower front sonars
sonars detects low obstacles
sonars randomly triggers needs some filtering
after restarting STM32 odometry jumps a bit

HARDWARE:
STM32 requires reset for odometry to work
Voltage regulator for lift motor sometimes stops working


Fixed:
ekf_odom and odom tranform both publishes to tf so it jumps around
