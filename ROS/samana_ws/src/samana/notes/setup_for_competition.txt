Step to setup robot for competition:

Before:
- Charge laptop, smartphone and hoverboard fully
- Check IMU calibration | If required recalibrate (always calibrate heading)
- Check if buck converters on 11V can lift the bag
- Update magnetic declination to event location

Setup:
- Connect android GPS and camera:
    - Enable smartphone GPS
    - Find IP in terminal write ip route and find last "ip scope link src 192.168.0.102 metric" append :11311/
    - Connect via ROS Sensors Driver on Android with same IP eg. http://192.168.0.102:11311
    - Connect android camera via DroidCam app

Other:
- For downloading new map tiles run
    - sudo docker run -p 8080:8080 -it -v ~/mapproxy:/mapproxy danielsnider/mapproxy

Right before launch:
- Make sure that all previous nodes are killed
- Set allow_rc to False | Check if auton mode is enabled
- Disconnect RC receiver
