Step to setup robot for competition:

Before:
- Charge laptop and hoverboard fully
- Check IMU calibration | If required recalibrate (always calibrate heading)
- Check if buck converters on 11V can lift the bag 

Right before launch:
- Make sure that all previous nodes are killed
- Set allow_rc to False | Check if auton mode is enabled
- Disconnect RC receiver
- Check is odometry working | Might need to repower Arduino
